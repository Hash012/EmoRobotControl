# Requirements for Advanced X Robot Control System
# This file contains all dependencies needed for the face tracking robot control system

# Core computer vision and image processing
opencv-python>=4.8.0          # OpenCV for camera operations and image processing
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0  # Headless version for servers without display

# Machine learning and AI
ultralytics>=8.0.0            # YOLO object detection for face tracking
numpy>=1.21.0,<2.0.0          # Numerical computing (constrained for compatibility)

# Robot control and hardware communication
fashionstar-uart-sdk>=1.0.0   # Fashion Star servo SDK for robot arm control
pyserial>=3.5                 # Serial communication for robot hardware

# Data processing and analysis
matplotlib>=3.5.0             # Plotting and visualization (for PID demo)
pandas>=1.3.0                 # Data manipulation and analysis

# Configuration and file handling
pyyaml>=6.0                   # YAML configuration file support
pathlib2>=2.3.0; python_version < "3.4"  # Path handling for older Python versions

# Optional dependencies for enhanced features
# Uncomment these if you want additional functionality:

# For advanced robot control (LeRobot integration)
# lerobot>=0.1.0

# For real-time plotting and monitoring
# plotly>=5.0.0

# For advanced PID tuning
# scipy>=1.7.0

# For machine learning model training
# torch>=1.9.0
# torchvision>=0.10.0

# For web interface (if needed)
# flask>=2.0.0

# For database storage (if needed)
# sqlite3  # Usually included with Python

# Development and testing dependencies
# pytest>=6.0.0
# pytest-cov>=2.0.0
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0

# Note: Some dependencies may have system-specific requirements:
# - OpenCV may require additional system libraries on Linux
# - Fashion Star SDK may require specific USB drivers
# - YOLO models will be downloaded automatically on first use

# Installation instructions:
# 1. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
# 2. Activate the environment: source venv/bin/activate (Linux/Mac) or venv\Scripts\activate (Windows)
# 3. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
# 4. For GPU acceleration (optional): pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
